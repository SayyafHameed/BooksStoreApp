Understanding ASP.NET MVC Data Transfer: ViewBag, ViewData, and TempData
![Uploading image.pngâ€¦]()


I'm excited to share this insightful infographic that breaks down the differences between ViewBag, ViewData, and TempData in ASP.NET MVC. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for effectively managing data transfer within your MVC applications. Here's a brief overview:

ViewBag

Transfers data from the Controller to View, perfect for temporary data that is not in a model.
Utilizes dynamic properties, taking advantage of C# 4.0 features.
Can assign any number of properties and values.
The data exists only for the current HTTP request.
Acts as a wrapper around ViewData.
ViewData

Also transfers data from Controller to View.
Derived from ViewDataDictionary, which is a dictionary type.
Values must be type cast before use.
Data exists only for the current HTTP request.
TempData

Stores data between two consecutive requests.
Uses Session internally, functioning like a short-lived session.
Values must be type cast before use and checked for null to avoid runtime errors.
Useful for one-time messages like error or validation messages.
